### Test

Standalone test project for Tilengine.

Features:
* Fixed the nasty mess that is the included .vcxproj file.
* Moves required libraries and resources to release folders.
* Standalone executables that work.
* Can be built anywhere (on my machine of course. :) )

Output: A CRT scanned Sonic the Hedgehog foreground.
